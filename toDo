0. add unit tests for individual methods in esSolve

1. Poisson

2. Parallelize: CUDA, OpenMP / MPI
     http://wiki.scipy.org/PerformancePython

3. testLinAlg needs more test cases

4. Change system exits to raise exceptions instead

5. esSolve.py --> poisson.py ?

6. Switch BCs from E to dV/dx to make more generic?

7. Get final 2D and 3D test cases working

8. Figure out how to deal with all neumann bcs (user specifies V at point?), or throw error if a user attempts it

9. Make class for field? should be generic (not potential-specific), plot() method

10. Make more test functions for esSolve.electricFieldAtPoint()

11. Add unit test for particle::push()

12. there's an issue where if you increase NX, the 1D test fails

13. Once get poisson implemented, then need mechanism for particle to feedbackon field (deposit charge)
